# Notes

Drop markdown files here with your thoughts on any topic.

aure will index them and use them to answer visitors' questions.
If a visitor asks about something not covered in your notes,
aure will honestly say it doesn't know.

## Naming

Name files however you want. aure reads them all.
A simple convention: `topic-name.md`

## Structure

Write naturally. The first `# Heading` becomes the topic label.
The rest is content that aure can draw from.
