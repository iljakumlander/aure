# CV Data

Put your CV data here in JSON format.

aure doesn't prescribe a CV schema — use whatever structure
makes sense for you. The LLM will interpret it.

A simple approach: one `cv.json` file with your experience,
education, skills, and projects.

The TypeScript interfaces for your CV structure can be added
to your private data repo — aure treats CV as opaque JSON
and lets the LLM make sense of it.
